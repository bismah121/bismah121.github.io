*"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a master of one."*

It's safe to say I took the above quote too literally for most of my life.

Currently, I am trying to teach myself how to DJ, and looking into buying my first controller. Before this, in terms of music, I have only played the keyboard at the beginner level, and the acoustic guitar at the intermediate level. I can also play very basic rhythm and some solos on the electric. I would love to learn how to play the drums one day. I love listening to rock, and my favorite album is [The Crimson Idol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVSqRZt7d6w&list=OLAK5uy_kw1tII8NLAAxQMHC3cl8OTvjZpJzzMFPk&index=2){:target="_blank"} by W.A.S.P.

I only play indie games. My favorite game of all time is **Hollow Knight**. Here's some really cool fan art:

Speaking of indie games, they got me into pixel art as well, which I'm not actively engaging in at the moment, but here is one of my best works:

I love reading classics and poetry, and my favorite poet is **Rainer Maria Rilke**. You can find what I'm reading [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120717191-bismah){:target="_blank"}. If I had to recommend one book to anyone, it would be [Letters to a Young Poet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46199.Letters_to_a_Young_Poet){:target="_blank"}.

Some additional things that I think are important:
- My favorite anime of all time is [Monster](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster){:target="_blank"}
- I play volleyball, and while I have learnt basic boxing, I would love to try the martial arts next
- I absolutely love board games; Monopoly and Settlers of Catan are favorites
- Some things I want to learn are iceskating, music production, and more physics
