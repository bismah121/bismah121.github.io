# Hello!
I'm Bismah -- a music enthusiast who works in physics research.

I'm also an incoming physics **PhD student** at the **Colorado School of Mines**. Before this, I was at **Lahore University of Management Sciences**, where I was working on open quantum systems -- more specifically, on quantum sensing and metrology (the study of measurement), which is also what my senior year thesis, supervised by [Dr. Adam Zaman Chaudhry](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=RNBPLXwAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, was based on.

At Mines, I will be working with [Dr. Lincoln Carr](https://scholar.google.ro/citations?user=7dfEr5YAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} on active feedback and control toward non von-Neumann computing models, such as quantum neuromorphic computing. To put that in more accessible language: most current computers use a design called the von-Neumann architecture, where processing occurs in a step-by-step fashion. However, the models I'm going to be working with are very different: *(1)*{: style="color: yellow;"} quantum computing, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics, allowing quantum computers to process massive amounts of information simultaneously, and *(2)*{: style="color: yellow;"} neuromorphic computing, where computers try to mimic the human brain's neural networks, allowing information to be processed in a more efficient manner.
