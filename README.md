# Hello!
I'm Bismah -- a music enthusiast who works in physics research.

I'm also a physics **PhD student** at the **Colorado School of Mines**. Before this, I was at **Lahore University of Management Sciences**, where I was working on open quantum systems -- more specifically, on quantum sensing and metrology (the study of measurement), which is also what my senior year thesis, supervised by [Dr. Adam Zaman Chaudhry](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=RNBPLXwAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, was based on.

At Mines, I'm working with [Dr. Lincoln Carr](https://scholar.google.ro/citations?user=7dfEr5YAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} on non von-Neumann computing models. To put that in more accessible language: most current computers use a design called the von-Neumann architecture, where memory and processing are kept separate, and information has to shuttle back and forth between them. However, nonâ€“von Neumann computing explores architectures where memory and processing happen together, or where the basic building blocks of computation are fundamentally different. Some examples of this include neuromorphic chips that mimic brain neurons, or quantum processors that use qubits instead of bits.
